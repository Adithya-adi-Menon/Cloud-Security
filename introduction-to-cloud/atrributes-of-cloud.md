# Atrributes of Cloud

\-> Five Attributes of the cloud :&#x20;

* Multitenancy - Sharing computing resources with many people but each data of the customer does not impact the other customer.
  * Multiple people can store their money in one bank, and their assets are completely separate even though they're stored in the same place. Customers of the bank don't interact with each other, don't have access to other customers' money, and aren't even aware of each other.
* Elasticity - The cloud can be customized according to the needs of the customer&#x20;
  * Everything starting from the CPU , storage and so on , can be easily customized.
* &#x20;Pay as you go  - No specific contracts set , pay based on the usage in cloud&#x20;
* Self-Provisioning of resources - Configuring cloud services without the need for IT management  , Just click a button to spin up a server&#x20;
* Massive Scalability&#x20;
